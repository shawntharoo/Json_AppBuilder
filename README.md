# Twilio Account Security Quickstart - Twilio Authy and Twilio Verify

A simple NodeJS and AngularJS implementation of a website that uses Twilio Account Security services to protect all assets within a folder with Two-factor authentication. Additionally, it shows a Verify Phone Verification implementation.

It uses four channels for two-factor authentication delivery, SMS, Voice, Soft Tokens, and Push Notifications. You should have the [Authy App](https://authy.com/download/) installed to try Soft Token and Push Authentication support.

This app uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as a data store. You will have to install MongoDB as well and make sure it is running.
